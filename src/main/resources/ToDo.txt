1. Find more efficient way for working all tests instead of @DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD)
[DONE] 2. Fix null values in id's (GET Regiments) - because of that it's inpossible to get troops.
3. Find more efficient way for method findTroopsByRegimentId - I want to search by Regiment, not finding all troops and filtering by Regiment id.
[DONE] 4. Find the way to not duplicate information about regiment in JSON (when using GET on team/1/teams
I see regiment under the team and also under the troop).
5. Create Validation for adding new teams (ex. teams' names cannot duplicate).
[DONE] 6. Security (signing in): new db tables for user and roles, make /login endpoint work :D
7. Security: add sign up
[DONE] 8. URGENT: solve the problem with logging: "failed to lazily initialize a collection of role"
9. Create authentication with tokens. Make research, find the best way to implement it.
[DONE] 10. Modify database (based on changes in documentation) - talk with IGOR
