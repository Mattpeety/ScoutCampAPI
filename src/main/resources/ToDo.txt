1. Find more efficient way for working all tests instead of @DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD)
[DONE] 2. Fix null values in id's (GET Regiments) - because of that it's inpossible to get troops.
3. Find more efficient way for method findTroopsByRegimentId - I want to search by Regiment, not finding all troops and filtering by Regiment id.
